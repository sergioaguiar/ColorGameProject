# Color Game

First upload of Color Game Project files (version 3). The project was developed a few years ago as a result of participating in an old version of The Web Developer Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). Two levels of difficulty were added to the project proposed by the course.
